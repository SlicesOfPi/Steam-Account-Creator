# Steam-Account-Creator

This.. well creates a steam account!

The idea behind all of it was to demonstrate how steam needs to stop the group spamming; turns out you need to spend a minium of $5 on Steam first, and that instead the groups appear to be on accounts with VAC bans, inactive, likely to be abandoned and either plain out given away or cracked. Most likely the cracked issue. Anyways, I'll keep it here as a indication of how Capatchas are not-so-effective particularly theirs.

They rely on capatchas it appears so much, I don't even need to enable proxy usage!!!
