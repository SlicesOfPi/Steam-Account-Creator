# Steam-Account-Creator

This.. well creates a steam account!

The idea behind all of it was to demonstrate how steam needs to stop the group spamming; turns out you need to spend a minium of $5 on Steam first, and that instead the groups appear to be on accounts with VAC bans, inactive, likely to be abandoned and either plain out given away or cracked. Most likely the cracked issue. Anyways, I'll keep it here as a indication of how Capatchas are not-so-effective particularly theirs.

## They rely on capatchas it appears so much, I don't even need to enable proxy usage!!!


My goal is to turn this into an automessanger someday. This was started with good intentions, but is it oh so much fun to do this. There is low white hat value here but.. Oh well.


### Usage:
The releases are currently zipped for good reason; they compiled jars aren't enough. Since a "proper java" method to do what I was doing was rather out of the way I went about creating a more "crude" method. There are two HTML files. Open refresh.html (and you might wanna shrink your browser tab. Sorry if this doesn't work terminal only) and start up the Java. It will ask you for the Capatha code. To make things clearer it will display 3 capatchas (refreshing ever second or two.) (Make sure it has updated to the most recent one. It should only be a second.) Go ahead and toss in the code for it there. It will display out your *brand new Steam account!*. The program currently lacks the ability to repeat itself (partially due to my novice/laziness) Part of the issue is that if the variable remails unreset it will cause a velociraptor to spew out of your screen sort of like using a [goto](https://www.xkcd.com/292/). I am familiar with both Linux and Windows but BAT/SH files aren't always my favorite thing in the world. If you would like to help create a few that'd be lovely! ( I could  also likely just create a java file that runs a console command but it seems.. Over-the-top there.)

You will need to click "Click Me!" to begin auto refreshing. The reason I opted to do this is.. well because I didn't want to start a setInterval to refresh something without the user intializing it first; whether I specify it well or not.

**Note:** I Don't love dead animals. I love animals and prefer them to be alive. Nor do I have dead animals.. Ish. I dislike it when some die. This was just what popped into mind (don't ask) when I was thinking for possible psuedo random passwords.
